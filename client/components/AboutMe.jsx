                <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
             <p>I am a graphic designer with some digital marketing skills. For me designing is a way of life, I cannot imagine a world without creativity. Other than design, I dabble in art, some Illustration as well as photography.</p><br />
             <p>The work I aim to do is 'out of the box', I am interested in fine-art graphic design, illustrative graphic design and digital art. The people I aim to work with are the dreamers, the doers and the innovators. I want to help contribute to their success. My goal is to work alongside start-ups to medium corporations, I want their visions to come alive.</p><br />
             <p>When Iâ€™m not designing, you can find me caught up in nature, having a Chai Latte, day dreaming of traveling or an art piece I want to create.</p><br />
             <p>I am passionate about people, good people make me happy. I would love to play a small role in positively impacting the world in some way that's for sure.</p><br />
